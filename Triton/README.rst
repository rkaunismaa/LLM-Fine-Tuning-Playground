All the python files in this folder were taken from the Triton repository found at 

https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/tree/main/python/tutorials

tutorials_python.zip was downloaded from [Triton Tutorials](https://triton-lang.org/main/getting-started/tutorials/index.html) home page. 
The code from here IS DIFFERENT than the code in the current repository! I have unzipped these files into the 'tutorials_pythons' folder.


Tutorials
=========

Below is a gallery of tutorials for writing various basic operations with Triton. It is recommended that you read through the tutorials in order, starting with the simplest one.

To install the dependencies for the tutorials:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd triton
    pip install -e './python[tutorials]'
