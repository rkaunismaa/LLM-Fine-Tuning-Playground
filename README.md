Working through [peft_finetuning.ipynb](https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes/blob/main/recipes/finetuning/huggingface_trainer/peft_finetuning.ipynb)

5) mamba install conda-forge::sentencepiece
6) pip install llama-recipes (notice the mis-spelling of recipes)

Trying to understand why running peft_finetuning.ipynb the first time training took 35 minutes, then running it again with profileing enabled from the copied notebook peft_finetuning_2.ipynb it took about a minute and a half, then re-running peft_finetuning_2.ipynb again, but with a different target folder of tmp-profile it again took about a minute and a half ... is this because of something to do with wandb?? I really don't get it ... 

Viewing the first 20 seconds of [LLAMA-3 ðŸ¦™: EASIET WAY To FINE-TUNE ON YOUR DATA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQmoog_s8HE) shows me right away there are multiple open-source libraries available to facilitate fine tuning of local large language models. Sooo much energy is being directed at this task and it is rapidly shifting, so keep on this!

The Youtube channel [Prompt Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/@engineerprompt/featured) is excellent! Gonna habituate looking at this channel!

Starting to run through the notebook 'Causal_models_like_Gemma_2B_finetuning_on_SamSum.ipynb', and looks like I have more stuff to install ...

 1) mamba install conda-forge::huggingface_hub
 2) mamba install conda-forge::ipywidgets
 3) pip install evaluate
 4) pip install rouge-score
